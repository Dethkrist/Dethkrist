# Welcome, my name is Alex Lukianov.

I am junior front-end developer. Now i'm working mainly with React, but i like to learn new technologies every time or i can do vanillaJS apps if it needed. 
My work is giving apps logic and life and connecting them with aesthetic of UI.
My path is long and hard, but i am ready to go further.

In the future i want to become a React Native/Flutter developer too.
