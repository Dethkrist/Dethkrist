Hello, im Alex Lukianov.

I've decided to change my life to development.

Now i'm learning frontend/web development, javaScript, CSS, HTML, especially Javascript.

Improving myself in React, in future it will be Angular, Vue, react Native.

Now i learn everything by myself.

Before i worked as a seaman, so English is not a problem for me.

I just want to create different interesting projects.
